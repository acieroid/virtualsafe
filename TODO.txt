  0. Find the best way to encrypt file on the server:
    - Using the user's public key
      - Advantage: more security, only the user can decrypt the
        files. When a file is shared, it can easily be securely
        de-shared
      - Disadvantage: when sharing a file from A to B, it has to be a)
        downloaded by A b) decrypted by A c) re-uploaded by A d)
        re-encrypted using B's public-key. And B have no gpuarantees
        that the shared file is the same as the original one, since A
        could have uploaded another file
    - Using a method similar to PGP: encrypt the file with a random
      key, and encrypt the key with A's public key, and store this
      - Advantage: to share, A has to decrypt the key, encrypt it with
        B's public-key and send this to the server
      - Disadvantage: once a file is shared, if A wants to de-share
        it, B will always know what was the key (even if it might not
        be able to download the file anymore). This might be avoided
        by reencrypting the file with a new secret key after
        de-sharing
  1. Admin panel: validate/invalidate users
  2. User panel: links to other user's page (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
  3. User password modification page
  4. User certificate download page
  5. User revocation page
  6. User upload page (needs 0 to be done)
  7. User file list page
  8. User share file page (needs 0 to be done)
  9. Java application: saves the private key and the certificate and
     can sign files, or decrypt encrypted files (needs 0 to be done)
